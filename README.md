# DragRacer
A Drag Racing game for the Arduboy

Lots of things still to implement:

 * Semi random drops of crate pickups
 * Get boost working
 * background road
 * Sign posts
 * Options screen
 * More pickups ?
 * Game Over when run out of fuel
 * Make the buggy bounce a bit - adjust buggyY up and down 1-2 pixels randomly.
 * Over rev damage
 * Gears / max revs & speed per gear
 * Different vehicles ? Unlikely, but worth considering
 * Fuel usage and distance a percentage of speed
